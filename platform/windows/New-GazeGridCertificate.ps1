1. Open your repository on GitHub.
   Go to Settings > Environments and create or open:
   windows-release

2. Under Environment secrets, choose Add secret and add BOTH:

   GAZEGRID_SIGNING_PFX_BASE64
     Value: the base64-encoded PFX. Use the clipboard prompt below,
     or run the displayed PowerShell command. Paste the entire value.

   GAZEGRID_SIGNING_PFX_PASSWORD
     Value: the exact password you chose when this script prompted you.
     Enter the password itself, not a SecureString or base64 value.

   These must be secrets, not environment variables. Do not upload the
   PFX or paste either secret into source files, issues, or workflow logs.

3. After pasting the PFX value, clear the clipboard in PowerShell:
   Set-Clipboard -Value ""

4. Commit and push the project's scripts and workflow files to GitHub.
   Open Actions > Signed Windows MSI > Run workflow.
   Leave Create a draft GitHub release enabled to create a versioned draft.
   After it succeeds, review the draft on the repository's Releases page
   and publish when ready. You can also download the
   GazeGrid-Windows-x64-signed artifact from the workflow run.
   It contains the signed MSI and public GazeGrid.cer certificate.
   The application executable inside the MSI is signed with the same identity.

   Use Signed Windows MSI for releases. Build and test uses a temporary
   test certificate rather than this persistent signing identity.

5. Before using the UIAccess application on a Windows machine:
   Verify the public GazeGrid.cer certificate, then have an administrator
   import it into Local Computer > Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
   Install the MSI into its default Program Files location.
   Distribute only the MSI and public CER; keep the PFX/password private.
   The MSI does not automatically change certificate trust.

To copy the encoded PFX later, run this command in PowerShell:
'@
Write-Host ('[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes(' + $quotedPfxPath + ')) | Set-Clipboard')
if ($interactiveSetup) {
    Write-Host ""
    $copyAnswer = Read-Host 'Copy the encoded PFX to the clipboard now? [y/N]'
    if ($copyAnswer.Trim() -match '^(y|yes)$') {
        try {
            [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($pfxPath)) | Set-Clipboard
            Write-Host 'Copied. Paste into GAZEGRID_SIGNING_PFX_BASE64, then clear the clipboard.'
        } catch {
            Write-Warning 'The certificate was created, but clipboard copying failed. Use the command above in a desktop PowerShell session.'
        }
    }
}
